# Leticia Dupleich Computer Science Projects
This repository showcases a collection of projects developed during my computer science studies. It includes:
- Algorithm implementations – practical solutions to classical and modern computational problems.
- Data structure analyses – experiments and evaluations of different data structures in terms of efficiency and performance.
- Software development projects – programs demonstrating coding best practices and real-world problem solving.
- Data science projects – analyses, visualizations, and experiments using datasets to extract insights and demonstrate statistical and machine learning skills.

Each project is organized in its own folder with clear documentation, allowing easy exploration of both the code and the concepts behind it.
