    "The storylines column unfortunately contained almost only reviews in place of the storyline. This was caused by a scraping issue we had which we initially thought was only the first half of each entry (first review then storyline) but it was that case that for almost all of the entries. At first, we thought perhaps there could be a way we could still include the reviews as an input for our model, but we soon realized that getting 1 review for each movie would be introducing noise. Moreover, many of the reviews have nothing to do with the actual content (storyline) of the movie but rather the actors, which our model is already using. Hence, we decided it was best to remove the storyline (i.e. the review) column."

    "Although we don't see a perfect elbow point, we do see that explained variance per PC decreases sizably throughout the graph. We decided to put a cutoff point of 4% (1/25) because we originally had 25 genres and didn't want to include a variance direction that would be contributing less than an individual genre if all were uncorrelated and had equal variances. This heuristic would suggest that we use 8 components, all of which explain more than 1/25 or 4% of the variance. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we also wanted to check where the slope change of the graph dropped below 0.5% from Principal Component to Principal Component to apply a heuristic based quasi elbow method. In the elbow method we landed on 6 PCs which wasn't far from 8 our initial heuristic found. But 6 components would explain less than 70% of the variance, which is a common threshhold for Principal Component Analysis. Hence, we decided to keep 8 components, explaining approximately 74% of the total variance, which is again around the common threshhold of 70-80%. We thought this would capture the important patterns in the data and would be less prone to noise."

    "\n",
    "So, we'll try two different methods for encoding these columns:\n",
    "1. **Frequency Encoding**. This involves replacing the original columns with new columns which have the frequency the directors and actors appear in the dataset. The reasoning for this is that directors and actors who continue to make high-quality and well-performing movies will continue to get funded, leading to them making more movies. This means that frequency encoding could be a good distinguishing feature for what makes a movie a blockbuster.\n",
    "2. **Target Encoding**. At first, we considered creating a heuristic metric that combines both gross worldwide income and average IMDB rating, but after some deliberation we decided to create two new columns, one for the average gross worldwide income, and one for the average averageRating, as this will lead better interpretability. In order to not predict the past from the future, we need to first split the data chronologically into training and testing datasets, measure the values for each director on the training dataset, and only then apply it to the testing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the process of encoding for the directors and actors is extremely similar, with only minor changes, we decided to make functions to avoid code repitition and create a good flow in the notebook.
