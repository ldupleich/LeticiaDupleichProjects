"""
This script is responsible for the preprocessing of the Hopsital Management Dataset
from Excel into Polars dataframes that can be used in the aggregation tasks.

The main steps necessary are:
    1. Load the data from Excel
    2. Remove any NULLs only if they appear in the dictionary
    3. Remove outliers (only numerical columns)
    4. Check for duplicate rows and remove if necessary (keep smallest primary key)
    5. Print row count (used to compare with SQL)

There are many additional checks within each function, and these were added as the code was
being developed and errors were thrown.

This file is imported and called prior to performing the aggregation tasks in "polars_aggregation".
This means that this file does not have to be run independently, it will be run automatically when
"polars_aggregation" is ran.
