Lab 2 - Single Socket / HTTP Server
NAME: Leticia Dupleich Smith
STUDENT ID: 15048748
DESCRIPTION:
This program implements a simple web server, called LeticiaServer that handles
one client at a time. The server works through a TCP socket that is bound to
a specific port that listens for any incoming requests. The first step when a
client sends an HTTP request to the server is parsing the request. Since this
simple server can only handle requests with the method GET, the program first
makes sure that the method is appropriate before processing it. If the method
is not GET then the server will throw a 501 Not Implemented error. Then, the
server will attempt to locate the requested file. If the file is not found,
the server responds with a 404 Not Found error. If the file is found, the
server returns a 200 OK message and with response headers: connection,
content-type,content-length, date, and server.

The server also manages cookies, or a counter of the number of HTML pages
visited by the client. Every time the client sends a request, the number
of cookies (page_count) is incremented. If the client has visited at least
one page, then the response header set-cookies will be appended to the
response header.

I chose to implement this server using object-oriented programming by
creating an HTTPServer class because it provides a cleaner and more
organized structure compared to using only isolated functions. By
encapsulating both the serverâ€™s data (such as the port and web root) and
its behavior (such as handling clients or sending responses) within a
single class, I was able to keep related functionality together and make
the code easier to follow.

        handle_client. This method was implemented to handle one client
        at a time.
